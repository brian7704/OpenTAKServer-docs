"OpenTAKServer prevents `@` and `:` characters in passwords. In certain "
"situations that use basic authentication,  such as viewing RTSP streams, "
"having these characters can cause an invalid URL. A typical URL when "
"using basic authentication looks like "
"`rtsp://username:password@server_address:8554/path`. In these situations,"
" the ':' character separates the username and password, and the `@` "
"character separates the username/password from the server address. Having"
" a password with these characters will cause browsers and video players "
"to incorrectly parse the URL."
