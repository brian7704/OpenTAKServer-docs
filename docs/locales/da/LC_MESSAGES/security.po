"For enhanced security, it is recommended that you disable the TCP CoT "
"streaming port and disable nginx from listening for unencrypted HTTP "
"requests on ports 80 and 8080. All data sent and received over these "
"ports is unencrypted. Any third party that intercepts the data will be "
"able to see things such as EUD locations, passwords, geochats, and other "
"data in the clear. To disable the TCP CoT streaming port, simply click "
"the switch in the TCP box of the UI's dashboard, or set the "
"`OTS_ENABLE_TCP_STREAMING_PORT` option to `false` in `config.yml`"

"Another concern is the Marti API. When TAK clients query the Marti API on"
" port 8080, they do not use any authentication. This means that any third"
" party that can access port 8080 on your server can interact with the "
"Marti API and do things such as upload/download data packages, query "
"video feeds, get a list of EUDs, etc, all without any authentication. "
"When querying the Marti API over HTTPS on port 8443, TAK clients sends a "
"client certificate which the server will verify. These certificates can "
"only be obtained by [certificate enrollment](certificate_enrollment.md) "
"which requires a username and password, or by having an administrator "
"generate a certificate data package and giving it to a user. To stop "
"nginx from listening on ports 80 and 8080, delete `/etc/nginx/sites-"
"enabled/ots_http` and restart nginx by running `sudo systemctl restart "
"nginx`."
