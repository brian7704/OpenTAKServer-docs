"There are four groups automatically when OpenTAKServer starts, "
"``__ANON__``, ``ADS-B``, ``AIS``, and ``Meshtastic``. The ``__ANON__`` "
"group is integral to the TAK ecosystem and can't be changed or deleted. "
"However the names of the ``ADS-B``, ``AIS``, and ``Meshtastic`` groups "
"can be changed via the ``OTS_ADSB_GROUP``, ``OTS_AIS_GROUP``, and "
"``OTS_MESHTASTIC_GROUP`` respectively."

"The Airplanes.live scheduled job will publish all data to the group "

" the group specified in ``OTS_AIS_GROUP``, and data received via MQTT "
"from Meshtastic nodes will be published to the group specified in "
"``OTS_MESHTASTIC_GROUP``. This allows users to enable or disable "
"whichever channels they want. However, the server administrator can "
"change these settings to ``__ANON__`` to send ADS-B, AIS, or Meshtastic "
"data to everyone."

"LDAP groups must be prefixed with the value of ``OTS_LDAP_GROUP_PREFIX`` "
"(default: ``ots_``). Groups without this prefix are ignored. "
"Additionally, group direction is specified with ``_READ`` and ``_WRITE`` "
"suffixes. These suffixes are case insensitive. For this reason, when "
"creating a TAK group on your LDAP server you will actually need to create"
" three groups. For example, if the group is called ``group1`` you would "
"create ``ots_group1``, ``ots_group1_read``, and ``ots_group1_write``. All"
" three are required. Then an administrator can assign ``ots_group1_read``"
" and ``ots_group1_write`` to users as needed."
