"OpenTAKServer can periodically delete old data from the database. This "
"feature can be enabled by an administrator on the Scheduled Jobs page of "
"the UI. The default settings will delete data (markers, location data, "
"R&B Lines, alerts, CoT messages, and EUDs) that are older than one week, "
"or EUDs that haven't connected within the last week. This interval can be"
" configured by adding or changing the following settings in config.yml"
