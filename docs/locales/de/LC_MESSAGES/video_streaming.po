"OpenTAKServer uses [MediaMTX](https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx) for"
" video streaming and recording. It accepts streams from apps such as "
"[OpenTAK ICU](https://github.com/brian7704/OpenTAK_ICU) and TAK ICU, as "

"OpenTAKServer supports streaming from any device that has a browser and a"
" camera. On the Video Streams page of OpenTAKServer's web UI there is a "
"button labeled `Start Streaming`. Clicking that button will prompt the "
"browser to ask for permission to use your device's camera and microphone "
"to stream audio and video to MediaMTX. This is helpful in situations "
"where someone with an Android or iOS device would like to stream to other"
" users on the server but they have no app to do so. Laptop and desktop "
"computers can also use this button to stream from their cameras."

"Note that streaming in this way only streams audio and video. Users can "
"view the stream on their EUDs, but no location information is included "
"with the stream, meaning there will be no icon on OpenTAKServer's or any "
"EUD's maps for the location of the stream."
