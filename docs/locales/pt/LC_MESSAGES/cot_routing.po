"OpenTAKServer uses [RabbitMQ](https://rabbitmq-website.pages.dev/) to "
"broker CoT messages between EUD's. When an EUD connects, OpenTAKServer "
"starts a new thread to handle sending and receiving CoT's. It also "
"declares and binds to a RabbitMQ queue for the EUD. Queues are also "
"declared for each team (Cyan, Magenta, etc) and EUDs are automatically "
"bound to those queues when they send a CoT with their team info."
