"The default port for certificate enrollment is `8446`. This port will use"
" one of two types of certificates, self-signed  or Let's Encrypt. The "
"default is to use self-signed certificates. If your server uses self-"
"signed certificates, you will need a copy of your server's truststore "
"certificate for auto-enrollment. You can download a copy at  "
"`https://your_server_address/api/truststore` or by logging into the web "
"UI and clicking the `Download Truststore` button."

#: ../../certificate_enrollment.md:24
msgid ""
"Starting in version 1.5.0, OpenTAKServer supports QR code generation for "
"ATAK certificate registration. This feature requires that your server has"
" a domain name with a trusted cert from Let's Encrypt or a similar "
"trusted certificate authority. When generating a QR code, you can "
"optionally specify an expiration date and a maximum number of uses. If "
"either or both are specified, the QR code will no longer work after the "
"expiration date or the maximum number of uses (whichever comes first). "
"The QR code can also be deleted. If it's scanned after being deleted, "
"certificate registration will fail."
msgstr ""

#: ../../certificate_enrollment.md:30
msgid ""
"Each user can only have one active QR code at a time but the code can be "
"deleted and regenerated at any time. The QR code is unique to the user "
"that generated it and should be treated like a password in most cases. "
"However, it is possible to generate a single QR code and let multiple "
"users scan it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../certificate_enrollment.md:34
msgid ""
"To scan the QR code, use your EUD's camera app or any QR code scanning "
"app. Once scanned, opening the link will automatically open ATAK and "
"start the certificate registration process. This method does not require "
"the user to uncheck the Preconfigured Trust option."
msgstr ""

#: ../../certificate_enrollment.md:38
msgid ""
"Alternatively, if you are logged into the web UI on your EUD you can tap "
"the `Open ATAK` button instead of scanning the QR code to start the "
