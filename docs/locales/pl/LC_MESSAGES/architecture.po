"As of version 1.5.0, OpenTAKServer is split into three parts, the API, "
"the EUD handler, and the CoT parser. Each part runs as its own separate "
"process. This solves a bottleneck issue caused by the [Python Global "
"Interpreter Lock "
"(GIL)](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock)."

msgid ""
"The EUD Handler listens on a TCP port, specified by "
"`OTS_TCP_STREAMING_PORT` or `OTS_SSL_STREAMING_PORT`, and is the main "
"point of interaction between OpenTAKServer and EUDs. When an EUD sends a "
"CoT message, `eud_handler` will publish it to RabbitMQ for `cot_parser` "
"to parse. Likewise, when another EUD publishes a CoT message, "
"`eud_handler` consume the message and send it to the EUD."

#: ../../architecture.md:14

"The CoT Parser connects to the RabbitMQ server and parses CoT messages "
"sent by EUDs. There can be multiple instances of CoT parsers running at "
"once. This allows you to take full advantage of your CPU cores if you "
"have a high number of incoming CoT messages per second. If there are too "
"many incoming CoT messages for the server to handle, additional servers "
"can run more instances of `cot_parser` for extra processing power."
