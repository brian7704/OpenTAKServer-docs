"You will need an account on AISHub with API access. Generally this "
"requires that you setup an AIS feeder and share your data with them. When"
" querying the API, they limit requests to no more than one per minute. "
"Keep this in mind when setting the query interval."

"`OTS_AISHUB_USERNAME` is the only required setting, the rest are "
"optional. However, it's a good idea to only query a small geographical "
"area or only a few specific vessels (or both). If you don't set a "
"location or specific vessels to query, AISHub will return all its data, "
"and you could end up with more than 50,000 points on your EUDs."
