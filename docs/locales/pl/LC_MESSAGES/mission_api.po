"As of version 1.4.0, OpenTAKServer supports the Mission API which enables"
" support for plugins such as Data Sync and Fire Area Survey. This API "
"only works when the EUD is connected to the server via SSL. Support for "
"the Mission API is in the early stages so there may still be bugs. If you"
" encounter any problems, please open a [GitHub "
"issue](https://github.com/brian7704/OpenTAKServer/issues)."
