"TAK Meshtastic Gateway listens for multicast data from TAK clients (ATAK,"
" WinTAK, and iTAK) and forwards it to a Meshtastic device which transmits"
" it to a Meshtastic network. It will also forward messages from "
"Meshtastic to  TAK clients via multicast. Additionally, it enables "
"sending and receiving chat messages and locations between TAK clients and"
" the Meshtastic app. For example, someone using WinTAK can send a message"
" over a Meshtastic network to someone using  the Meshtastic app and vice "
"versa."
