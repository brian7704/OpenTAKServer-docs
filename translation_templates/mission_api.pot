msgid "As of version 1.4.0, OpenTAKServer supports the Mission API which enables support for plugins such as Data Sync and Fire Area Survey. This API only works when the EUD is connected to the server via SSL. Support for the Mission API is in the early stages so there may still be bugs. If you encounter any problems, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/brian7704/OpenTAKServer/issues)."
