msgid "As of version 1.5.0, OpenTAKServer is split into three parts, the API, the EUD handler, and the CoT parser. Each part runs as its own separate process. This solves a bottleneck issue caused by the [Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock)."

msgid "EUD Handler"
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.md:8
msgid "The EUD Handler listens on a TCP port, specified by `OTS_TCP_STREAMING_PORT` or `OTS_SSL_STREAMING_PORT`, and is the main point of interaction between OpenTAKServer and EUDs. When an EUD sends a CoT message, `eud_handler` will publish it to RabbitMQ for `cot_parser` to parse. Likewise, when another EUD publishes a CoT message, `eud_handler` consume the message and send it to the EUD."

#: ../../architecture.md:12
msgid "CoT Parser"
msgstr ""

#: ../../architecture.md:14
msgid "The CoT Parser connects to the RabbitMQ server and parses CoT messages sent by EUDs. There can be multiple instances of CoT parsers running at once. This allows you to take full advantage of your CPU cores if you have a high number of incoming CoT messages per second. If there are too many incoming CoT messages for the server to handle, additional servers can run more instances of `cot_parser` for extra processing power."
